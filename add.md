ARTICLE 6: GENDER-SPECIFIC HEALING AND EMPOWERMENT SPACES
Recognizing that Africa's renewal requires addressing the specific needs of all its people, COPIN fosters interconnected, gender-responsive spaces:
    • Women & Girls Empowerment Division: Leads our core mission, focusing exclusively on the empowerment, education, and leadership of women and girls.
    • Male Healing and Engagement Division: Provides safe spaces for African men and boys, addressing unhealed trauma and fostering positive masculinity to build a cohort of allies for a more equitable society.
ARTICLE 7: PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
COPIN’s primary objectives are to position African women and girls, starting from Nigeria, as the central architects of their own and the continent's renewal:
    • Education Sovereignty: Scholarships, internships, and technology access primarily for girls and women.
    • Health Justice: Women-run health services, menstrual equity, and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services.
    • Eco-Leadership: Women as primary stewards of land, water, and wildlife guardianship.
ARTICLE 8: SECONDARY OBJECTIVES
Our secondary objectives create the supportive ecosystem necessary for our primary mission to flourish:
    • Male Allyship & Healing: Cultivating programs for positive masculinity, trauma counseling, and engaging men as partners in peace and gender equality.
    • Girl-Centered Innovation: Establishing STEM labs, eco-champion training, and career internships for girls.
    • Arts & Music Liberation: Deploying therapy, cultural, and advocacy projects for community healing.
    • Animal-Human Solidarity: Training women and vulnerable survivors as wildlife rangers and animal carers.
    • African Crisis Response: Mobilizing women-led relief efforts, legal empowerment, and food security campaigns.
    • Pan-African Research & Partnerships: Forging formal ties with private sector, universities, and NGOs across the continent.
ARTICLE 9: OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES
    • African-Led Leadership Quota: At least 70% of management and staff are women; at least 50% are from vulnerable groups within local communities.
    • Strategic Resource Allocation: A minimum of 60% of the budget is directed to women-and-girl-focused programs; a minimum of 30% supports mixed-gender or male-engagement initiatives that benefit vulnerable populations and promote holistic community healing.
    • Impact Tracking for Africa: Performance is measured using education, income/ownership, and leadership indices for women and girls, with complementary metrics on male participation in healing programs and their development as allies.
